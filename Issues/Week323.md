Happy Thursday! [CocoaHub](https://cocoahub.app/), an app that aims to be the perfect companion app for iOS developers by highlighting news and articles from the Apple developer community [has been officially launched](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1467755462).

In other news, [Dave Verwer](https://twitter.com/daveverwer) has published the results for the [iOS Developer Community Survey](https://iosdevsurvey.com/2019/). There's a lot of data, and there's something for everyone. Have fun reading the results, and if you have ideas on what other analysis can be done on the data, or want to do some nice visualizations, ping Dave.
